        <p>The majestic lion, Panthera leo, stands as a powerful symbol of strength and nobility, belonging to the cat family Felidae and the prestigious genus Panthera. Renowned for its muscular physique, particularly evident in the males' striking manes, the lion is a social animal, living in prides that coordinate hunting and raise cubs together. While now primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small endangered population in Gujarat, India, fossil evidence suggests lions originated in Africa during the Pleistocene epoch, spreading throughout Eurasia and even reaching North America before becoming extinct in those regions. Their adaptability to diverse habitats, from savannahs to grasslands, has played a significant role in their historical distribution, though habitat loss and human conflict have drastically reduced their range in modern times.</p>
