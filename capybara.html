        <p>The capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, is the world's largest rodent, a semi-aquatic mammal native to South America. These sociable creatures thrive in a variety of habitats, always in close proximity to water, including swamps, rivers, and marshes. Their physical adaptations, such as webbed feet and a slightly upturned snout, make them excellent swimmers and allow them to remain submerged for extended periods. Historically, capybaras were first documented and classified in the 18th century, with initial observations suggesting origins in the marshlands and river systems of Brazil and the surrounding regions. These gentle giants are herbivores, grazing on grasses and aquatic plants, and their presence plays a vital role in the ecological balance of their wetland environments.</p>
